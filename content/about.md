## For Contributors

- Ensure minutes are formatted as a Markdown file (Google Docs can natively export these)
- Upload the `week-x.md` file under `content/minutes` in the correct term and year folder after they have been approved.
- The file path should be `content/minutes/termT-yyyy/week-x.md`, where `T` is the current term, `yyyy` is the current year, and `x` is the current week.
- Actionables are to be carried as a Markdown checklist to the following week's minutes.

## For Maintainers
